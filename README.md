# QSC

Check it.

Decided to add jQuery to the website I was building for my independent study.
Did some cool stuff to the search bar.
Mobile view search bar expands in and out on click.
Reg search highlights keywords (list items) you choose, on click, from drop down.

Things to work on:
    Add highlighting functions to mobile search bar
    Make Prettier
    Let someone type and search any keyword
        (might be hard cause when user types, presses enter or clicks 'submit', the page re-loads)
